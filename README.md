## :alarm_clock: Paraverse
Paraverse is an interactive web application designed to explore historical, political, cultural, and fictional events through speculative "what if" scenarios. It allows users to reimagine real-world events by presenting alternative outcomes that often contradict established factsâ€”creating thought-provoking paradoxes. This platform fosters critical thinking and creative exploration by encouraging users to revisit past moments and construct alternate narratives that challenge conventional perspectives.
